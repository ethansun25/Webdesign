# Webdesign

I just wanted to say that making a sub-page for each country took a LONG time and it might have been a better idea to focus on format rather than 
finishing the website, but I honestly like that it is finished, even if the style could be a bit improved. Because there were so many sub-pages I
needed to make, it is very likely that some of the data might be wrong because I probably mistaked miles with km for the land area a couple of times 
and the population I used for some countries were from years ago. There might have also been some errors while copy and pasting, so some data from 
other countries might appear in the wrong one. Lastly, I tried finding the best quality photos, but when they're so big, they always end up blurry. 
If there's any way to make the images more clear, please let me know. Otherwise, I'm still very proud of my website and I learned a lot of new things,
especially how to make different pages in a website.
